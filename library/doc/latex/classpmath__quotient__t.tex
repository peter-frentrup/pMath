The Quotient class.  


Inherits \hyperlink{classpmath__rational__t}{pmath\_\-rational\_\-t}.



\subsubsection{Detailed Description}
The Quotient class. 

Because \hyperlink{classpmath__quotient__t}{pmath\_\-quotient\_\-t} is derived from \hyperlink{classpmath__rational__t}{pmath\_\-rational\_\-t}, you can use pMath integers wherever a \hyperlink{classpmath__rational__t}{pmath\_\-rational\_\-t} is accepted.

The \hyperlink{group__objects_ge2646df76dcb0113715322b13a1f36f0}{pmath\_\-type\_\-t} of quotients is {\tt PMATH\_\-TYPE\_\-QUOTIENT}. However, you rarely test on this but on {\tt PMATH\_\-TYPE\_\-RATIONAL}, because quotients whose denominator divides the numerator without a remainder, are converted to \hyperlink{classpmath__integer__t}{pmath\_\-integer\_\-t} automatically. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file:\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
pmath-core/numbers.h\end{CompactItemize}
